# AirBnB Data Modeling Project ‚úàÔ∏èüè°
# Project Overview :
This document outlines the business need for data modeling of Airbnb listings data for Barcelona, focusing on extracting insights to improve user experience and enhance decision-making for both hosts and guests.

Tools used: Excel,Power BI

**Specific business requirements that needs to cover in modeling:** 

*1. Identify cost-effective options:*

Determine the cheapest listing with the highest availability in a specific month (January 2024). This helps budget-conscious travelers find the most affordable accommodations.

*2. Highlight popular listings:*

Identify listings with the most reviews in a particular month (November 2023). This aids travelers in discovering highly rated and potentially desirable options based on past guest experiences.

*3. Analyze neighborhood trends:*

Determine the neighbourhood with the highest average listing price. 

*4. Provide personalized recommendations:*

Develop a system to recommend listings based on user-specified criteria. This includes:

. A family vacation scenario for a man, wife, and 2 children seeking a week-long stay around March 2024 (accommodating capacity and family-friendly amenities).

. A group of college students (5 people) seeking a budget-friendly option for New Year's Eve celebrations, including two additional days before and/or after (consider capacity, affordability, and proximity to festive events).
